Instructions for using the template

This template is meant to include the most appropriate file structure for a new CRAFTY model to start with.
However, depending on your model it might be a better idea to start from another configured project.

In order to adjust this template to your context, search all files for "TEMPLATE" and replace that string
with a suitable substitute.

Currently known files are:
./config/ant/FetchBackResults.xml
./config/ant/ReleaseToLinuxCluster.xml
./config/cluster/resources/Eddie_CraftySerialModel.sh
./config/cluster/resources/Eddie_CraftyParallelModel.sh
